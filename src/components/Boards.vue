Before joining IITA, he was Director of the Nairobi-based CIAT-TBSF. Dr Sanginga has more than 30 years’ experience in the fields of applied microbial ecology, plant nutrition, and integrated natural resources management in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. He has worked with the University of Zimbabwe, IAEA in Austria, and CIAT-TSBF, in agricultural research and development. 
Prior to transferring to CIAT-TSBF late 2002, Dr. Sanginga spent 14 years at IITA in various capacities, including principal scientist and head of soil microbiology unit; project coordinator of Improvement of high intensity food and forage crop systems and Short fallow systems to arrest land degradation due to land use intensification; and leader of the multidisciplinary program Improving and intensifying cereal-legume systems in moist and dry savannas of WCA, collaborating with many scientists in national and international institutions. His career has also focused on building the capacity of young scientists in Africa. 
Born and bred in DRC, Dr Sanginga did most of his postgraduate training at IITA and his PhD in Agronomy/Soil Microbiology under a joint program and development partners in DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.
In 2012, after being IITA DG for a year, Sanginga developed a new model that curbs youth unemployment but also aims to solve the problem of food insecurity in the coming years. This initiative was based on the premise that African youth will develop interest in agribusiness if the conditions are attractive. This model, now known as IITA Youth Agripreneurs (IYA) has transcended the walls of IITA to being adopted by various nations, governments, banks, and world development agencies. Today, the youth often refer to Sanginga as Father of youth-in-agribusiness.
